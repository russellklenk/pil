GEODE is a library for creating and managing windows, user input, display 
output and audio input and output. SDL2 is used internally to abstract away 
the platform differences, and Vulkan is used for rendering and interfacing 
with the GPU.

GEODE is intended to be used from a higher-level language like Rust, to avoid 
having to work directly with complex bindings to SDL2 and Vulkan.
